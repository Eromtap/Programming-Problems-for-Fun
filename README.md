# Programming-Problems-for-Fun
Just a collection of programming challenges I do for practice and curiosity


Are these the best possible solutions to the programming challenges? In most cases, almost certainly not, but I like to do these as if I were in an interview / test setting. So the goal here is to get a working script to solve the problem and nothing more.
